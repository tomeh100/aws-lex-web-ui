# Amazon Q Business Integration

Amazon Q is a new generative AI-powered application that helps users get work done. Amazon Q can become your tailored business expert and let you discover content, brainstorm ideas, or create summaries using your companyâ€™s data safely and securely. For more information see: [Introducing Amazon Q, a new generative AI-powered assistant](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-q-a-new-generative-ai-powered-assistant-preview)

This feature of the Web UI lets you use Amazon Q's generative AI directly with the Web UI, using a deployed sample bot as a passthrough to the Q Business application. This allows your solution to take advantage of the native Web UI features - embedding, customization, etc - while still leveraging the answering capabilities of Amazon Q.

This feature supports integration with file attachments, enable both to allow QBusiness to read files uploaded via Lex Web UI. There's more information on this feature in the [File Upload README](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lex-web-ui/blob/master/README-file-upload.md). 

### Prerequisites
1. An existing deployment of a Q Business application is required for this solution. Please reference the AWS docs for creating a new [Q Business application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application.html)

### Deploy the Web UI
1. A deployment of the Lex Web UI with login enabled is required for Q Business integration

2. The other bot fields for both V1 & V2 bots must be empty for the template to create the Q Business integration bot, please ensure that `Lex V1 Bot Configuration Parameters` and `Lex V2 Bot Configuration Parameters`

3. In the `Q Business Parameters` section of the template, provide the Amazon Q Application ID. For now, leave the 'IDCApplicationARN' field blank. This application must be created after Cognito is deployed by the initial Web UI deployment and the stack can be updated later to provide this value.

3. Deploy the stack.

4. When the stack is finished deploying (showing a CREATE_COMPLETE status) go the Outputs tab. You will need the following Outputs for setting up the Identity Center Application:
    - CognitoUserPoolClientId
    - CognitoUserPoolPubKey
    - QBusinessLambdaRoleARN

### Creating an Trusted token issuer in Identity Center

1. The Cognito user pool created by the Web UI will need to be added as **Trusted token issuer** to Identity Center by doing the following steps. Note that if you are not an admin in your organization, an administrator with Identiy Center access might need to create the token issuer and application.
    1. Go to Identity Center and click on `Settings`, then `Create trusted token issuer`
    2. The issuer URL will be the **CognitoUserPoolPubKey, but remove /.well-known/jwks.json from the end of the URL**, the issuer URL you supply shoudl be in the form of  `https://cognito-idp.[region].amazonaws.com/[cognito-pool-id]`. The application also needs to be provided with attribute mapping between Identity Center and Cognito to recognize users, this should be a unique attribute for each user (the default is email address)

    3. With a trusted token issuer in place, the custom application can now be created.

### Creating an Identity Center Application w/ Cognito trust

1. A custom application will need to be created in Identity Center to handle the connection between your Q Business application and your Cognito pool. Follow these steps to create the application.
    1. Go to Identity Center and click on `Applications` then `Add application`
    2. Select `I have an application I want to set up` and `OAuth 2.0` on the next page for Selecting Application type, then hit `Next`
    3. For `Application URL`, provide the **Web experience URL** of your Q Business application. You can either opt to assign specific users/groups to this application or allow any Identity Center users/groups to access the application. Your Q Business subscriptions will still apply however so only users with a subscription can successfully chat with the application. Then hit `Next`.
    4. Select the Trusted token issuer that was created in Step 2 of this guide, you will now need an aud claim so that the token issuer can identify the application. This aud claim is created when you deploy the Lex Web UI and can be found within the Coginto User pool. To find this value go to your Cognito user pool and select the `App integration` tab and scroll to the bottom. The aud claim is the **CognitoUserPoolClientId** output value from the Web UI stack. Take this value and paste it into the aud claim field, then select `Next`
        ![Claim](./img//aud-claim.PNG)
    5. You will need to wait until after you deploy the CloudFormation stack to provide the role on the Specify application credentials page. For now, provide any existing IAM role in your environment and hit `Next`.
    6. When your application is created, you may need to still assign users to it. These will be the same users you have assigned to the Q Business application.
    7. Finally, you must make Amazon Q a trusted application for identity propagation, when complete your app should appear similar to the below configuration
        ![IdentityPropagation](./img//identity-propagation.PNG)
    8. Copy the `Application ARN` found on this page, it will be used to update the Lex Web UI in the next section.

### Update the Lex Web UI stack

1. Return to CloudFormation and click on the stack that was initially used to deploy the Web UI.
2. On the top-right menu, select `Update`
3. Leave the default of 'Use existing template' and hit `Next`
4. Under Q Business Parameters, find the **IDCApplicationARN** and paste the `Application ARN` copied at the end of the previous section.
5. Launch the update of the stack.


## After inti
The default behavior is to relay the user's query to Amazon Q Business as the user input. If LLM_QUERY_GENERATION is enabled, the generated (disambiguated) query will be used, otherwise the user's utterance is used.  
Alternatively, you can supply an explicit `"Prompt"` key in the `QnAItemLambdaHookArgs` value. For example setting `QnAItemLambdaHookArgs` to `{"Prefix":"Amazon Q Answer:", "ShowContextText":true, "ShowSourceLinks":true, "Prompt":"Why is the sky blue?"}` will ignore the user's input and simply use the configured prompt instead. You may find this useful if you use the function as a Lambda Hook for QnA items that match explicit lists of utterances/questions, and you want to normalise these into a single static question to ask Amazon Q. Prompts supplied in this manner do not (yet) support variable substitution (eg to substitute user attributes, session attributes, etc. into the prompt). If you feel that would be a useful feature, please create a feature request issue in the repo, or, better yet, implement it, and submit a Pull Request!
